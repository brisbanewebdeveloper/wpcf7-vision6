[email* your-email placeholder "Email"]

[text* your-first-name placeholder "First Name"]

[text your-last-name placeholder "Last Name"]

[acceptance your-consent]I consent to the <a target="_blank" href="#">conditions</a>.[/acceptance]

<div class="mb-3">[recaptcha]</div>

[submit "Subscribe"]
```

## Field Mapping

This plugin automatically maps the fields between Contact Form 7 and Vision 6 as assuming both sides have the same field names. So if Contact Form 7 has the field `your-email`, the field `Field Name` at Vision 6 side is expected to have `your-email` as well. But do not jump to the conclusion about the naming rule by that. Just keep reading:

![Field Mapping for Default Behaviour](assets/field-mapping-default-behaviour.png "Field Mapping for Default Behaviour")

Above behaviour makes the email for Admin have `your-email` instead of the value of `Field Display Name`.

![Email for Default Behaviour](assets/field-mapping-default-behaviour-email.png "Email for Default Behaviour")

If that is not acceptable or you cannot be bothered at matching up the field names, you can add the following code to `functions.php` and amend it to map the fields:

```php
/**
 * @param WPCF7_ContactForm $contact_form
 * @param WPCF7VISION6 $api
 * @param WPCF7_Submission $submission
 *
 * @return array
 */
function my_wpcf7vision6_get_contact_details($contact_form, $api, $submission) {
    $posted_data = $submission->get_posted_data();
    return [
    //  'Field Name at Vision 6' => $posted_data['Field Name at Contact Form 7']
        'Email' => $posted_data['your-email'],
        'First Name' => $posted_data['your-first-name'],
        'Last Name' => $posted_data['your-last-name'],
        'Mobile Phone' => $posted_data['your-phone'],
    ];
}
add_filter('wpcf7vision6_get_contact_details', 'my_wpcf7vision6_get_contact_details', 10, 3);
```
